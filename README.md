# Shazam-Like-app
A shazam-like app me and [@sudowicked](https://github.com/sudowicked) created for a university class.

A vital part of this project was [this](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23332-robust-landmark-based-audio-fingerprinting) library.

A video demonstrating the app's functionality can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-dbCmugTGQ).
